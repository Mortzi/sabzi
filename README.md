# ursa

This is a command line tool for saving urls with category and tag.
Mongodb is used for persisting data.

supported commands:

  add [url] [category] [tag] => saves a url
         for example : ursa add https://github.com/mortzi/ursa github ursa
         
  list(ls) => lists all urls
  
  remove [url] => removes the specified url
  
 Soon I hope to add more commands, tags, and options as it is an initial form of 'ursa'
